# Final_Project_School_Data

# Data, Math, Data.
This project collects the quarterly Math test scores of the students at a Texas Middle School. 
From these scores, an analysis will be performed on the students primarily focusing on the achievement levels of two of the schools sub-populations, Black and Hispanic students. At the end of this analysis, we will be able to determine which Sub-Population performed the best and use this data to plan for the next steps for each Sub-Population as they prepare for their State Assessment.
